                        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Eighteen years ago Daniel Grancea assumed the responsibility and role as the 
                            Head Coach of the University of Pittsburgh Rowing Club. Coming into a team built on potential, 
                            he had a vision for the future that perhaps few could perceive. Over the years Daniel has invested 
                            unimaginable amounts of his time and energy into building a lasting legacy for the University of Pittsburgh Rowing Club.</p>
  
                        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In these eighteen short years this vision has become a reality. Under Daniel's leadership, the team has come 
                            to achieve numerous institutional and athletic successes, acquiring a brand new fleet of racing shells, 
                            the development of a strong network of administrative and financial relations, and of course, medals earned on the water.</p>
  
                        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Recognized in 2011 and 2022 as ACRA regional coach of the year, Dan continues to encourage the qualities of 
                            perseverance, self-discipline, pride, and passion in all his rowers as athletes and individuals in our everyday lives.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Zachary rowed at Canisius High School in Buffalo, NY for four years before coming to the University of Pittsburgh to continue his rowing career. At Canisius, Zachary won a gold medal at SRRA National Championships in the Senior 4+, and qualified for Youth Nationals that same year. While on Pitt crew, Zachary qualified for Grand Finals in the Varsity and Junior Varsity 4+ at Dad Vails, and he won medals at various other collegiate races. After his fourth year on Pitt crew, Zachary injured his back and decided to become a novice men’s coach to give back to a team that gave him so much as an undergrad at Pitt. Zachary coached the 2021-2022 novice men’s team through his final year at the University of Pittsburgh, and hopes to continue coaching the men’s team as a varsity coach for the 2022-2023 year.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Apoorva joined the University of Pittsburgh's rowing team as a novice during his freshman year, and continued rowing until his senior year on varsity. He was the men’s captain his junior year, and on the board various other years. Rowing became an important part of Apoorva’s lifestyle here at Pitt. He developed many important friendships, relations, and skills that transformed his overall college experience. Now, Apoorva has the wonderful opportunity to coach the varsity women after a successful novice women’s season, and wishes to use what he learned to foster an environment based on dedication and hard work.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Julia Roselli joined the coaching staff this fall to coach the novice women. Julia is originally from
                          Buffalo, NY, and spent her high school years rowing for Nardin Academy. When she began
                          studying at Pitt, she continued her rowing career while pursuing a degree in Industrial Engineering.
                          She was captain of her high school team as well as the Pitt team. Julia's high school rowing success
                          includes winning Canadian-US Nationals in her lightweight 8 and placing 3rd at US Scholastic
                          Nationals in the same boat. At Pitt, her pair with Taylor Mathis earned silver at Dad Vails and her
                          Varsity Club 4+ also earned silver at Dad Vails that year.
                          Her love for coaching began a few years ago when she was an assistant coach for the Summer
                          Rowing League at Three Rivers Rowing. The next year she started coaching at her home
                          boathouse, West Side Rowing Club, as the Head Coach of their new Adult Learn to Row
                          program. She was also a counselor for Crew Camp and a coach for Masters Rowing and Learn to
                          Scull programs. Julia hopes to continue the success she had as a rower in her coaching career and is
                          excited about the future spring season for her novice women.</p>

                          Occoquan because of the challenging turns. This is Alex’s first time
                          coaching but he is very excited to see what the novice men can
